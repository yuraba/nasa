## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

the next step is to go to the page and you will see a green button, click on it to load 10 photos
also by refreshing the page and selecting a certain camera - only those photos that were taken with this camera will be displayed
similarly with route
