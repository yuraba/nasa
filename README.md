This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

the first step is to go to the page and you will see green buttons, selecting a certain camera, route , sol - and clicking load photo and then loadMore will display only those photos that were taken by this camera, will be displayed similarly to the route
